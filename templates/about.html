    <h1>Hey there</h1>
    
    <h4 style="margin-top: 45px; margin-bottom: 15px;">About me</h4>

    <p class="para">I am Tahmid Bin Haque. My hometown is Rajshahi. I am currently in my 2nd semester at Brac University studying CSE. Sports, music and movies are most of the things I am interested in. I was learning web development for a while. This is my first ever big project. I was taking a course named CS50x by Harvard University somewhat 8 month ago. I was done with most of the tasks within two months but there was a final project that I had to submit. Well this is it. I could have chosen a much easier project to just finish the course but it wasn't good enough for me. I was also admitted into the university at that time. That's why with some procrastination it took almost a month to finish and polish up the project.</p>

    <h4 style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Origin story</h4>

    <p class="para">I tend to lose stuff a lot. When I moved to Dhaka about two months ago. Just in the first month, I lost a phone, a calculator a headphone, and two sets of keys. So that's when the idea for my final project came. A website where people can post their lost items and if someone finds them who can look them up. Kinda like bikroy.com but for lost items. I designed a lot of the elements with green and red colors to create a BD aesthetic.</p>
